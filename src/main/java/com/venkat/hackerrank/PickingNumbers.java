/**
 * Given an array of integers, find the longest subarray where the absolute difference between any two elements is less than or equal to 1.
 *
 * Example
 * a = [1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5]
 * There are two subarrays meeting the criterion: [1,1,2,2] and [4,4,5,5,5]. The maximum length subarray has 5 elements.
 *
 * Function Description
 * Complete the pickingNumbers function in the editor below.
 * pickingNumbers has the following parameter(s):
 * int a[n]: an array of integers
 *
 * Returns
 * int: the length of the longest subarray that meets the criterion
 *
 * Input Format
 * The first line contains a single integer n, the size of the array a.
 * The second line contains n space-separated integers, each an a[i].
 *
 * Constraints
 * 2 <= n <= 100
 * 0 <= a[i] <100
 * The answer will be >= 2.

     * To find the length of the longest subarray where the absolute difference between
     * any two elements is less than or equal to 1, we can use a frequency counting approach.
     *
     * First, we'll create a frequency array to count the occurrences of each element in the given array.
     *
     * Next, we'll iterate through the frequency array and check the count of each element and
     * its neighboring element. If the count of the neighboring element is higher than the current
     * element or if the neighboring element is within the range of Â±1, we'll update the maximum length accordingly.
     *
     * Finally, we'll return the maximum length as the result.
